# Identity WG Charter

## Purpose

The Identity Working Group exists to define the initial set of standards that enable the creation of a flexible, modular, platform-agnostic identity standard on Ceramic.

## Goals

The goals of the Identity Working Group are to:

- create a widely-supported, DID-agnostic standard for decentralized identity that can support:
  - authentication from one or many different accounts
  - verified links to external accounts and contracts
  - a flexible profile system
  - various kinds of public and private social graph information
  - links to external sources of data
  - links to external services that can perform actions on behalf of the identity
- produce a library that implements the standard

## Deliverables

**Create a widely supported DID-agnostic standard for decentralized identity**

- an identity standard (IS) ([CIP-N](https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/issues/3)), consisting of
  - an account model ([CIP-N](https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/issues/21))
  - a keychain model ([CIP-N](https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/issues/13))
  - an account linking model ([CIP-N](https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/issues/14))
  - a profile model ([CIP-N](https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/issues/12))
  - a connections model (CIP-N)
  - a sources model ([CIP-N](https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/issues/26))
  - a services model ([CIP-N](https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/issues/19))
  - a claims model ([CIP-N](https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/issues/16))

**Produce a library that implements the standard**

- identity-standard-3id

## Success

We will know that this working group has been successful when the above deliverables have been met, and when the process has been derisked/validated through testing.


## Organization

- **Meeting Schedule**: The group will meet via video once every two weeks for a 60 minute call. These calls can be found on the CEA calendar and are named "Ceramic Governance WG". Anyone in the CEA can view the calendar and attend the calls.

- **Meeting Notes**: Meeting minutes will be captured for every meeting, recorded using the [Meeting Notes Template](templates/meeting-notes-template.md) and stored in the [Ceramic Governance V1/Meetings](working-groups/ceramic-governance/meetings) folder.

- **Discussions**: The group will use the [#ceramic-governance-wg](https://discord.gg/s5TfHct) Discord channel on the Ceramic Discord server for discussions and chat. This channel is available to anyone in the CEA.

- **Proposals**: The group will produce official Ceramic Governance proposals in the form of [CIPs](http://github.com/ceramicnetwork/cip).
