# Charter for Identity working group

## Purpose

The Ceramic Identity V1 Working Group exists to create alignment on the core identity-related protocols, documents and formats built on Ceramic Network, considering use cases from infrastructure services, technology providers, and app builders to ensure an interoperable standard. 

## Goals

The goals of the Identity Working Group are to review, iterate on and formalize Ceramic community standards for:

- Authentication to a DID (keychain) 
- Resource indexing around a DID (e.g., databases) 
- Public profiles
- Linked accounts (crypto and 0auth) 
- Social connections and graph 
- 


## Deliverables

The initial focus of the Identity Working Group will be on the first two CIPs corresponding to the above goals: 

- [CIP 10 - Identity Index Protocol](https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/issues/3)
- [CIP 11 - Root Index](https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/issues/21)

This will include discussion of the subdirectories, including: 
- [CIP 12 - Profiles Index](https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/issues/12)
- [CIP 13 - Accounts Index](https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/issues/14)
- [CIP 14 - Keychains Index](https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/issues/13)
- CIP 19 - Auth Keychain


## Success

Success includes getting these CIPs (or there successive iterations) finalized and approved, with commitments from working group members to prototype or use the standards in relevant projects. 


## Organization

- **Meeting Schedule**: The group will meet via video once every 2 weeks for a 90 minute call. These calls can be found on the CEA calendar and are named "Identity Working Group". Anyone in the CEA can view the calendar and attend the calls.

- **Meeting Notes**: Meeting minutes will be captured for every meeting, recorded using the [Meeting Notes Template](templates/meeting-notes-template.md) and stored in the Identity Working Group  folder.

- **Discussions**: The group will use the #identity-wg Discord channel on the Ceramic Discord server for discussions and chat. This channel is available to anyone in the CEA.

- **Proposals**: The group will produce official proposals in the form of [CIPs](http://github.com/ceramicnetwork/cip).
