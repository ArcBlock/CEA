# Identity v1 WG Charter

## Purpose

The Ceramic Identity V1 Working Group exists to create alignment on the core identity-related protocols, standards, and formats built on the Ceramic Network, considering use cases from infrastructure services, technology providers, and app builders to ensure an interoperable standard. 

## Goals

The goals of the Identity WG are to review, iterate, and formalize Ceramic community standards that provide cross-platform interoperability:

- Structuring an identity-centric index of a DID's resources to enable permissionless discovery and routing.
- Controlling/authenticating a DID with one/many wallet keys to enable simple integration with tools already possessed by users.
- Profiles to enable contextualization of identity in a familiiar way.
- Linked third-party accounts to enable "soft" identity verification and the transmission of reputation from existing sources.
- Social connections and graph to enable a standard way to represent and share a user's relationships.


## Deliverables

The initial focus of the Identity WG will be on the first three CIPs corresponding to the above goals: 

- [3ID (DID) Doctype (CIP-6)](https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/issues/6)
- [Identity Index (IDX) (CIP-11)](https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/issues/3)
- [Root Index (CIP-12)](https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/issues/21)

This will include discussion of the IDX subdirectories, including: 

- [Keychains Index (CIP-15)](https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/issues/13)
- [Profiles Index (CIP-13)](https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/issues/12)
- [Accounts Index (CIP-14)](https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/issues/14)

This will also include documents linked from those subdirectories, including:

- [Auth Keychain (CIP-20)](https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/issues/33)
- [Basic Profile (CIP-19)](https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/issues/32)
- [Crypto Account Links (CIP-21)](https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/issues/44)
- [Social Account Links (CIP-22)](https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/issues/43)

This will also include documents that the documents above depend on, including:

- [CAIP-10 Link Doctype (CIP-7)](https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/issues/15)
- [Linked Accounts Array (CIP-23)](https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/issues/55)


## Success

Success includes getting the above CIPs (or their successors) finalized and approved, with commitments from working group members to prototype or use the standards in relevant projects. 


## Organization

- **Meeting Schedule**: The group will meet via video once every 2 weeks for a 90 minute call. These calls can be found on the CEA calendar and are named "Identity WG". Anyone in the CEA can view the calendar and attend the calls.

- **Meeting Notes**: Meeting minutes will be captured for every meeting, recorded using the [Meeting Notes Template](templates/meeting-notes-template.md) and stored in the Identity WG folder.

- **Discussions**: The group will use the #identity-wg Discord channel on the Ceramic Discord server for informal discussions and chat. This channel is available to anyone in the CEA.

- **Proposals**: The group will produce official proposals in the form of [CIPs](http://github.com/ceramicnetwork/cip).
