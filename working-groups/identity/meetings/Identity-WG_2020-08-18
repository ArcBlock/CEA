working-group: Identity WG
date: 2020-08-18
```

## Agenda
1. Share and discuss existing concepts of decentralized identity to establish a common understanding. Weâ€™ll start from the basics and work up:
    1. [Decentralized identifiers (DIDs)](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) and DID methods
    2. Verifiable credentials
    3. [Identity Hubs](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/identity-hub/blob/master/explainer.md) / [Secure Data Stores](https://identity.foundation/secure-data-store/) and existing implementations
2. Share the Identity work done to date on Ceramic, including goals and design:
    1. [3ID DID method](https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/issues/6)
    2. [Identity Index (IDX)](https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/issues/3), a proposed way to implement Hub functionality in a decentralized, p2p way on Ceramic
    3. Auxiliary identity data standards, including [basic profiles](https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/issues/32), social graphs, etc.
    4. Verifiable credential doctypes
3. Break up Identity WG into sub-topics that can be parallelized
    
## Goals
1. Alignment on purpose and motivation of Identity WG on Ceramic
2. Break up Identity WG into smaller, focused sub-groups
