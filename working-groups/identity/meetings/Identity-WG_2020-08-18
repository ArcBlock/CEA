working-group: Identity WG
date: 2020-08-18
```

## Agenda
1. Share and discuss existing concepts of decentralized identity to establish a common understanding. Weâ€™ll start from the basics and work up:
    1. [Decentralized identifiers (DIDs)](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) and DID methods
    2. Verifiable credentials
    3. [Identity Hubs](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/identity-hub/blob/master/explainer.md) / [Secure Data Stores](https://identity.foundation/secure-data-store/) and existing implementations
2. Share the Identity work done to date on Ceramic, including goals and design:
    1. [3ID DID method](https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/issues/6)
    2. [Identity Index (IDX)](https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/issues/3), a proposed way to implement Hub functionality in a decentralized, p2p way on Ceramic
    3. Auxiliary identity data standards, including [basic profiles](https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/issues/32), social graphs, etc.
    4. Verifiable credential doctypes
3. Break up Identity WG into sub-topics that can be parallelized
    
## Goals
1. Alignment on purpose and motivation of Identity WG on Ceramic
2. Break up Identity WG into smaller, focused sub-groups

## Notes
- Overview of DIDs
Started with attaching credentials to a URL + use cases in the crypto world; came together at RWOT 
- Overview of SDS
Giving people the ability to store data associated with DIDs in an encrypted way and ensure the data host has no view into the data. 
Encrypted data vault client -- that's where keys live to access the information. 
Keep the two layers entirely separate. Developed in work with DHS in supply chain management so folks can store stuff in an encrypted data vault.. 
That work was being done under the auspices of the W3C credentials community group. Simultaneously, 'hub work' at DIF was that + intelligence about what is in the data collection (movies, friends list, etc.). Generalizing it so people could store the data + the index about it so it would be useful
Combined the working groups into SDS. First EDV and then align hub vision with that so there's a complete stack.
Strong push for syncronization and replication are automatically part of it .. 2 service providers in real time (E.g., your own backup somewhere) 
My data community is important here. "MyData operators" helping people manage there data, 7 different operators. Some of those companies will shift over and adopt these standards. Right now they are in the wild working. At least 2 companies with EDVs based on the specification as it was. 
Q. is there anything about 1:1 matching (anti-sybil, proof of human) 
A. there are a bunch of protocols working on global human uniqueness (idema, brightid). It's not a problem IIW is trying to solve 
side-convo on the approaches of unique-human approaches and dangers
- How Ceramic fits into this 
Needs around identity management are shared -- very similar goals. 
The mechanism of discovery of resources and routing to them -- there was no way to do this in a decentralized way. 
"Identity management" = provide context and capabilities to a DID
People in the dweb wanted these capabiilities but a non-starter to rely on a centralized hub to do this 
Part of what's being done with agent work and DIDCOMM -- pairwise identifiers for every relationship that i have, with other people and entities, and each one has its own channel that i connect to them on...social network itself is radically decentralized because I don't have a persistent identifier for all those relationships 
When you push more to the edges, you make them do more work, and there is more likely to be centralization vectors 
How do you ensure those don't get weight..a lot of it is through open standards and ensuring keys live with the users
"Decentralization rubric" and how to think about the different options and what outcomes they look for 

-What role does Ceramic bring to this that's different? 
Is it a similar approach to the traditional software identity world, or are we aiming for a very different view? 
Are we designing for a legal conceptualization or how the world actually works? Personal data or interpersonal data? 
How can it be edge-centric not node-centric?
