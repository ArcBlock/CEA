CEA Town Hall - Kickoff
date: <2020-08-12>
---

## Agenda
- Introductions
- CIP Process 
- Role of the CEA
- Working Group Process
- Initial Working Groups (Identity) 

## Notes
- The CEA as a community and forum to coordinate on anything related to Ceramic, use cases for its smart document functionality, or generally building a more interoperable web.
- Work will be mostly focused on specific working groups, which can self-organize to push specific areas of interest or need ahead. There is a charter template anyone can use to create a new working group
- The main output of working groups are Ceramic Improvement Proposals (CIPs)
- What's the IPR for this? Not too formal right now, all open source and CIPs are CC0
- Over time, the CEA may take on more formal roles (e.g., Ceramic Governance) and requirements; this evolution can happen through a future "Meta CEA" working group
- What's the relationship to standards like DIF? Need to discuss more later. Drawing on DID spec and aligned to those standards, but take a different approach within the ecosystem 
- Identity Working Group can go into this more next week. 
- Timing for that - should it shift for DIF CCG meeting? TBD
- Is "Identity" too big? Yes, will break into smaller groups
