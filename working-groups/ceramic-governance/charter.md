# Ceramic Governance WG Charter


## Purpose

The Ceramic Governance Working Group exists to define the initial set of processes that enable Ceramic to operate as a thriving, fully open-source, collaborative community.


## Goals

The goals of the Ceramic Governance Working Group are to establish:

- open forums for community engagement
- an open process for creating self-organizing working groups
- an open process for proposing protocol improvements or implementation standards
- an open forum for deciding what features get included in future network upgrades


## Deliverables

**Open forums for community engagement**

- [Community Discord]() ([CIP-X]())
- [Community Calls]() ([CIP-X]())

**Open process for self-organizing working groups**

- [Ceramic Ecosystem Alliance (CEA)](http://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CEA) ([CIP-X]())

**Open process for proposing protocol improvements/implementation standards**

- [Ceramic Improvement Proposals (CIPs)]() ([CIP-X]())

**Open forum for deciding what features get included in future network upgrades**

- [Core Devs Calls]() ([CIP-X]())


## Success

We will know that this working group has been successful when the above deliverables have been met, and when the process has been derisked/validated through testing.


## Organization

- **Meeting Schedule**: The group will meet via video once every two weeks for a 60 minute call. These calls can be found on the [CEA calendar]() and are named "Ceramic Governance WG". Anyone in the CEA can view the calendar and attend the calls.

- **Meeting Notes**: Meeting minutes will be captured for every meeting, recorded using the [Meeting Notes Template](templates/meeting-notes-template.md) and stored in the [Ceramic Governance/Meetings](working-groups/ceramic-governance/meetings) folder.

- **Discussions**: The group will use the [#ceramic-governance-wg](https://discord.gg/s5TfHct) Discord channel on the Ceramic Discord server for discussions and chat. This channel is available to anyone in the CEA.

- **Proposals**: The group will produce official Ceramic Governance proposals in the form of [CIPs](http://github.com/ceramicnetwork/cip).
