# Governance Working Group Charter (V1) 


## Purpose

The Ceramic Governance WG exists in its first phase (V1) to define the initial set of processes that enable Ceramic to operate as a thriving, fully open-source, collaborative community.


## Goals

The goals of the Ceramic Governance Working Group over time will be to establish open forums and processes for:

- community engagement
- creating self-organizing working groups
- proposing protocol improvements or implementation standards
- deciding what features get included in future network upgrades
- progressively decentralizing governance of Ceramic Network 

The first phase of the WG (v1) will be focused on initial community engagement and contribution forums en route to devnet and mainnet launches of Ceramic. 

## Deliverables

Several forums have already been created for community engagement: 
- [Community Discord](https://discord.gg/6VRZpGP) for ongoing discussion 
- [Community Calls](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/b/3?cid=Y2VyYW1pYy5uZXR3b3JrX3JsNzFrcXZtNzE4ZGY4aWk2cDZzanNmbDdjQGdyb3VwLmNhbGVuZGFyLmdvb2dsZS5jb20) for tri-weekly live discussions on developments in the Ceramic Network and ecosystem 
- [Core Devs Calls](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/b/3?cid=Y2VyYW1pYy5uZXR3b3JrX3JsNzFrcXZtNzE4ZGY4aWk2cDZzanNmbDdjQGdyb3VwLmNhbGVuZGFyLmdvb2dsZS5jb20) for tri-weekly live discussions and decisions on what features to include in network upgrades 

**Create an open process for protocol improvements and standards working groups**

The first two deliverables related to governance have been proposed as CIPs: 
- [Ceramic Ecosystem Alliance (CEA)](http://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CEA) (See [CIP-3](https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/issues/40))
- [Ceramic Improvement Proposals (CIPs)](http://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP) (See [CIP-1](https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/blob/master/CIPs/CIP-1/CIP-1.md))

Additional deliverables may be added as the CEA begins active working groups. 

## Success

We will know that this working group has been successful when 
- the above deliverables have been met, tested and completed
- CIPs are being contributed by the community
- the first working group stewarded by non-core developers has been formed


## Organization

- **Membership**: Anyone interested in providing constructive feedback, fostering community engagement, or supporting progressive governance and decentralization can participate in the working group if they have joined the CEA

- **Meeting Schedule**: During V1, Governance topics will be covered as part of CEA Town Halls, which take place every 6 weeks and can be found on the CEA calendar. Anyone in the CEA can view the calendar and attend the calls. The Governance WG will begin meeting regularly on its own schedule after V1. 

- **Meeting Notes**: Meeting minutes will be captured for every meeting as part of the CEA Town Hall notes. They will be recorded using the [Meeting Notes Template](templates/meeting-notes-template.md) and stored in the [Ceramic Working Groups](https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CEA/tree/master/working-groups) folder.

- **Discussions**: The group will use the [#ceramic-governance-wg](https://discord.gg/s5TfHct) Discord channel on the Ceramic Discord server for discussions and chat. This channel is available to anyone in the CEA.

- **Proposals**: The group will produce official Ceramic Governance proposals in the form of [CIPs](http://github.com/ceramicnetwork/cip).
